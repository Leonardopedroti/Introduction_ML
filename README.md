# Introduction_ML

This analysis was developed by @letpires in their challenge #7DaysOfCode!, where for 7 days, participants receive a daily challenge, with the aim of analyzing data from Spotify and predicting, with the help of machine learning, the popularity of each song. During the challenge, libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Searborn, Matplotlib and Sckit-lear were used to create and analyze models.
All content generated through this challenge is merely personal learning.
